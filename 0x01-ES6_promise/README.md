ES36 Promises
This project is about promises(how, why, and what)
In this project I have learned how to use the then, resolve, and catch methods
There are some additional concepts too that I have exercised in this project
0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep
1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
2. Catch me if you can!
3. Handle multiple successful promises
4. Simple promise
5. Reject the promises
6. Handle multiple promises
7. Load balancer
8. Throw error / try catch
9. Throw an error
10. Await / Async
